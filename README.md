# DogsVsCats
Introduction:
Here we use Computer Vision skills to build an image classifier to classify an image as that of a dog or of a cat. Here we are using Pretrained VGG16 model to train the model.
The goal is to classify the images into their respective classes using accuracy as a metric.

Dataset:
The dataset consists ofÂ 
1. Train (Folder): contains 9471 images of cats and dogs.
2. Test (Folder): contains 4059 images of cats and dogs.
